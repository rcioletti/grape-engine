C++ Game Engine

This game engine is being developed by me to be used in game jams 

## Features

  * Deploy games on Windows or Linux using [Vulkan](https://www.vulkan.org/)
  * Develop quick prototypes or advanced 3D Games
  * Cross-platform input support via [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/)
  * Nvidia PhysX as the physics engine
  * Engine editor made with [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)
  * Better code organization via maps and game objects

A Demo of the Engine running some 3D models and point lights.

Most of the GPU overhead is caused by the recording program.
