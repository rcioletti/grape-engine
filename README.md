# üçá Grape Engine

C++ game engine for quick prototypes, game jams and tinkering with graphics and tools.  
Grape Engine focuses on Vulkan rendering, a lightweight editor, and a straightforward game object system to make experimentation easy.

## Features

- Vulkan-based renderer
- Windowing and input via [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/)
- Physics integration with NVIDIA PhysX
- Editor UI using [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)
- GameObject / entity management for clearer code structure
- Support for 3D model import and point lights

A short demo showing the engine working.

## Roadmap

- [ ] More physics features: joints, constraints, ragdolls
- [ ] Asset importer & pipeline improvements
- [ ] Scene serialization and prefab support
- [ ] Editor UX improvements (inspector, hierarchy, scene view)
- [ ] Audio subsystem
- [ ] Performance profiling and optimization
- [ ] Example projects / sample games
